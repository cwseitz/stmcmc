abstract = {BACKGROUND: The chemical master equation (CME) is a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the evolution of a network of chemical reactions as a stochastic process. Its solution yields the probability density vector of the system at each point in time. Solving the CME numerically is in many cases computationally expensive or even infeasible as the number of reachable states can be very large or infinite. We introduce the sliding window method, which computes an approximate solution of the CME by performing a sequence of local analysis steps. In each step, only a manageable subset of states is considered, representing a "window" into the state space. In subsequent steps, the window follows the direction in which the probability mass moves, until the time period of interest has elapsed. We construct the window based on a deterministic approximation of the future behavior of the system by estimating upper and lower bounds on the populations of the chemical species. RESULTS: In order to show the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to several examples previously described in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method speeds up the analysis considerably, compared to a global analysis, while still providing high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The sliding window method is a novel approach to address the performance problems of numerical algorithms for the solution of the chemical master equation. The method efficiently approximates the probability distributions at the time points of interest for a variety of chemically reacting systems, including systems for which no upper bound on the population sizes of the chemical species is known a priori.},

abstract = {The mathematical framework of the chemical master equation (CME) uses a Markov chain to model the biochemical reactions that are taking place within a biological cell. Computing the transient probability distribution of this Markov chain allows us to track the composition of molecules inside the cell over time, with important practical applications in a number of areas such as molecular biology or medicine. However the CME is typically difficult to solve, since the state space involved can be very large or even countably infinite. We present a novel way of using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) to reduce the size of the finite state projection (FSP) method. Numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the reduction are included.},

@article{Munsky2006,
abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection ({\{}FSP){\}} method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation ({\{}CME).{\}} Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm ({\{}SSA){\}} or $\tau$ leaping, the {\{}FSP{\}} directly solves or approximates the solution of the {\{}CME.{\}} If the {\{}CME{\}} describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the {\{}FSP{\}} method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the {\{}FSP{\}} method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed {\{}FSP{\}} algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate {\{}FSP{\}} exists, the {\{}FSP{\}} algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The {\{}FSP{\}} is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the {\{}FSP{\}}, the {\{}SSA{\}}, and $\tau$ leaping algorithms. In both examples, the {\{}FSP{\}} outperforms the {\{}SSA{\}} in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the {\{}FSP{\}} also performs far more effectively than $\tau$ leaping methods.},

@article{Elowitz2000,
abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of mRNA and protein expression at the single-cell level can reveal fundamental information about cellular response to external stimuli, including the sensitivity, timing, and regulatory interactions of genes. Here we describe a fully automated system to digitally count the intron, mRNA, and protein content of up to five genes of interest simultaneously in single-cells. Full system automation of 3D microscope scans and custom image analysis routines allows hundreds of individual cells to be automatically segmented and the mRNA-protein content to be digitally counted. Single-molecule intron and mRNA content is measured by single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH), while protein content is quantified though the use of antibody probes. To mimic immune response to bacterial infection, human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the expression of two inflammatory genes, IL1Î² (interleukin 1Î²) and TNF-Î± (tumor necrosis factor Î±), were simultaneously quantified by monitoring the intron, mRNA, and protein levels over time. The simultaneous labeling of cellular content allowed for a series of correlations at the single-cell level to be explored, both in the progressive maturation of a single gene (intron-mRNA-protein) and comparative analysis between the two immune response genes. In the absence of LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of IL1Î² and TNF-Î± were uncorrelated. Following LPS stimulation, mRNA expression of the two genes became more correlated, consistent with a model in which IL1Î² and TNF-Î± upregulation occurs in parallel through independent mechanistic pathways. This smFISH methodology can be applied to different complex biological systems to provide valuable insight into highly dynamic gene mechanisms that determine cell plasticity and heterogeneity of cellular response.},
